# ðŸŒ¤ Solecito

A collection of MATLAB functions for the detailed simulation of photovoltaic plants.

The project began in 2013 as an extension of PVLIB (Matlab), answering the need of independent consultant Hugo Capdevila for a PV simulation software that could account for the effects of electrical layout and complex geometry in shading and mismatch losses. Since then, several commercial tools have caught up to consider string layout information in some way or another. But our library still offers unique features that might be of value to the PV modelling community. Namely:

- View factor calculation for arbitrary tessellations of the sky dome, allowing the calculation of anisotropic diffuse shading. Our custom polygonal projection approach accounts also for the cosine-response of the modules for each diffuse irradiance component.

- Spherical interpolation of diffuse 3D view-factors, and adaptive resolution of direct-shading calculations, reducing the computational expense of run-time electrical simulations. 

- Performance optimized C++ library for One-Diode-Model current-voltage (IV) curve calculations, and series-parallel IV curve addition (by Huan Zhou).

- Functions for probabilistic sensor-fusion of irradiation data, including quality control, irradiance separation, and transposition (See [matlab-pvmeteo](https://github.com/martinherrerias/matlab-pvmeteo) and [radiance_RBE](https://github.com/martinherrerias/radiance_RBE)).

## Acknowledgements

Since 2019, the code has been reworked in the framework of the **HyForPV** project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag. The project was comissioned and supported privately for years by Hugo Capdevila -- I trust he would be happy to see it bear fruit, even if not in the way he envisioned. Thanks to the financial support of the Mexican National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), in 2011-2013.

## Use

#### 0. Try running the `startup.m` function from Matlab. It should add all the required folders to the path, and compile all libraries. If it worked, congratulations! jump to step 4... otherwise grab a coffee, and go to step 1.

#### 1. Clone the repository (*with submodules!*):

`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:martinherrerias/PV4K-matlab.git`

#### 2. Add code to the matlab path (note some folders are removed, to avoid path cluttering and name conflicts):

```
BASEDIR = '~/PV4K-matlab';  % your cloned repository
cd(BASEDIR);
addpath(genpath('.'));
rmpath(genpath('./.git'));
rmpath(genpath('./tests/ODM'));

rmpath(genpath('./pvCplusplus'));
addpath('./pvCplusplus/mexMdpwl');

rmpath('./matlab-pvmeteo/PVLIB/Example Data');
rmpath('./external/clipper/cpp');
rmpath(genpath('./external/jigsaw/jigsaw-matlab'));
```

#### 3. Compile CPP libraries

- Compile C++ One-Diode-Model and Piece-Wise-Linear electrical solver
```
cd(fullfile(BASEDIR, 'pvCplusplus/mexMdpw'));
commonBuiltScript()
addSeriesBuiltScript()
addParallelBuildScript()
ODMpwlapproxBuildScript()
```

- Compile CLIPPER polygon-clipping library/mex wrapper (see `/external/clipper/matlab/README.txt`)
```
cd(fullfile(BASEDIR,'external/clipper/matlab'));
cd('./external/clipper/matlab');
mex '-D__int64=__int64_t' '-I../cpp' '../cpp/clipper.cpp' 'mexclipper.cpp'
```

- Compile JIGSAW mesh refining utility (see `/external/jigsaw/jigsaw-matlab/README.md`)
```
cd(fullfile(BASEDIR,'external/jigsaw'));
initjigsaw()
compile()
endjigsaw()
```

#### 4. (Optional) add user accounts

User accounts are required to access [SoDa](http://www.soda-pro.com/) and [geonames](https://www.geonames.org/). In most cases these provide optional features (look for the option `useweb = false`). To use the services, modify the file `./Remote/useraccounts.txt` with your credentials and save as `useraccounts.m`:

```
copyfile('./Remote/useraccounts.txt','./Remote/useraccounts.m');
% (update `useraccounts.m` with your credentials)
```

To avoid repeated web requests (or to allow manual downloads), _mcclear*.csv_ and _merra2*.csv_ files can also be retrieved from local folders in the search-path. Files are identified by name (see `getremote.searchexisting`). The functions `merra2_healthcheck` and `mcclear_healthcheck` can be used periodically to auto-rename the files and speed-up the search:

```
addpath('~/Documents/CAMS/MERRA2');
copyfile('./Remote/resources/merra2_healthcheck.m','~/Documents/CAMS/MERRA2');

addpath('~/Documents/CAMS/McClear');
copyfile('./Remote/resources/mcclear_healthcheck.m','~/Documents/CAMS/McClear');
```

#### 5. Test
