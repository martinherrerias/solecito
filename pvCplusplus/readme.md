1. [eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [libigl](https://libigl.github.io/) are external libraries for supporting our PV C++ project
  a) we use the Eigen library to manage some matrix or array problem.
  b) we further use the libigl library to mimic some linear algebra routines in Matlab.
2. pvProj is the c++ project in linux
3. mexMdpwl contains the corresponding mex executables, which can be called in matlab
